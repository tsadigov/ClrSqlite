    /// modified.
    ///
    /// The szOsFile field is the size of the subclassed [sqlite3_file]

    /// ^If a suffix is added to the zFilename parameter, it will

    /// The file I/O implementation can use the object type flags to
    /// change the way it deals with files.  For example, an application

    /// the open of a journal file a no-op.  Writes to this journal would
    /// also be no-ops, and any attempt to read the journal would return
    /// SQLITE_IOERR.  Or the implementation might recognize that a database
    /// file will be doing page-aligned sector reads and writes in a random
    /// order and set up its I/O subsystem accordingly.
    ///
    /// SQLite might also add one of the following flags to the xOpen method:

    /// <ul>
    /// <li> [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE]
    /// <li> [SQLITE_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE]

    /// databases, and subjournals.
    ///
    /// ^The [SQLITE_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE] flag is always used in conjunction
    /// with the [SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE] flag, which are both directly
    /// analogous to the O_EXCL and O_CREAT flags of the POSIX open()
    /// API.  The SQLITE_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE flag, when paired with the
    /// SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE, is used to indicate that file should always
    /// be created, and that it is an error if it already exists.
    /// It is <i>not</i> used to indicate the file should be opened
    /// for exclusive access.
    ///
    /// ^At least szOsFile bytes of memory are allocated by SQLite
    /// to hold the  [sqlite3_file] structure passed as the third
    /// argument to xOpen.  The xOpen method does not have to
    /// allocate the structure; it should just fill it in.  Note that
    /// the xOpen method must set the sqlite3_file.pMethods to either
    /// a valid [sqlite3_io_methods] object or to NULL.  xOpen must do
    /// this even if the open fails.  SQLite expects that the sqlite3_file.pMethods
    /// element will be valid after xOpen returns regardless of the success
    /// or failure of the xOpen call.
    ///
    /// [[sqlite3_vfs.xAccess]
    /// ^The flags argument to xAccess() may be [SQLITE_ACCESS_EXISTS]
    /// to test for the existence of a file, or [SQLITE_ACCESS_READWRITE] to
    /// test whether a file is readable and writable, or [SQLITE_ACCESS_READ]
    /// to test whether a file is at least readable.   The file can be a
    /// directory.
    ///
    /// ^SQLite will always allocate at least mxPathname+1 bytes for the
    /// output buffer xFullPathname.  The exact size of the output buffer
    /// is also passed as a parameter to both  methods. If the output buffer
    /// is not large enough, [SQLITE_CANTOPEN] should be returned. Since this is
    /// handled as a fatal error by SQLite, vfs implementations should endeavor
    /// to prevent this by setting mxPathname to a sufficiently large value.
    ///
    /// The xRandomness(), xSleep(), xCurrentTime(), and xCurrentTimeInt64()
    /// interfaces are not strictly a part of the filesystem, but they are
    /// included in the VFS structure for completeness.
    /// The xRandomness() function attempts to return nBytes bytes
    /// of good-quality randomness into zOut.  The return value is
    /// the actual number of bytes of randomness obtained.
    /// The xSleep() method causes the calling thread to sleep for at
    /// least the number of microseconds given.  ^The xCurrentTime()
    /// method returns a Julian Day Number for the current date and time as
    /// a floating point value.
    /// ^The xCurrentTimeInt64() method returns, as an integer, the Julian
    /// Day Number multiplied by 86400000 (the number of milliseconds in

    /// ^SQLite will use the xCurrentTimeInt64() method to get the current
