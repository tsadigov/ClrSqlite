    /*
** A open page cache is an instance of struct Pager. A description of
** some of the more important member variables follows:
**
** eState
**
**   The current 'state' of the pager object. See the comment and state
**   diagram above for a description of the pager state.
**
** eLock
**
**   For a real on-disk database, the current lock held on the database file -
**   NO_LOCK, SHARED_LOCK, RESERVED_LOCK or EXCLUSIVE_LOCK.
**
**   For a temporary or in-memory database (neither of which require any
**   locks), this variable is always set to EXCLUSIVE_LOCK. Since such
**   databases always have Pager.exclusiveMode==1, this tricks the pager
**   logic into thinking that it already has all the locks it will ever
**   need (and no reason to release them).
**
**   In some (obscure) circumstances, this variable may also be set to
**   UNKNOWN_LOCK. See the comment above the #define of UNKNOWN_LOCK for
**   details.
**
** changeCountDone
**
**   This boolean variable is used to make sure that the change-counter 
**   (the 4-byte header field at byte offset 24 of the database file) is 
**   not updated more often than necessary. 
**
**   It is set to true when the change-counter field is updated, which 
**   can only happen if an exclusive lock is held on the database file.
**   It is cleared (set to false) whenever an exclusive lock is 
**   relinquished on the database file. Each time a transaction is committed,
**   The changeCountDone flag is inspected. If it is true, the work of
**   updating the change-counter is omitted for the current transaction.
**
**   This mechanism means that when running in exclusive mode, a connection 
**   need only update the change-counter once, for the first transaction
**   committed.
**
** setMaster
**
**   When PagerCommitPhaseOne() is called to commit a transaction, it may
**   (or may not) specify a master-journal name to be written into the 
**   journal file before it is synced to disk.
**
**   Whether or not a journal file contains a master-journal pointer affects 
**   the way in which the journal file is finalized after the transaction is 
**   committed or rolled back when running in "journal_mode=PERSIST" mode.
**   If a journal file does not contain a master-journal pointer, it is
**   finalized by overwriting the first journal header with zeroes. If
**   it does contain a master-journal pointer the journal file is finalized 
**   by truncating it to zero bytes, just as if the connection were 
**   running in "journal_mode=truncate" mode.
**
**   Journal files that contain master journal pointers cannot be finalized
**   simply by overwriting the first journal-header with zeroes, as the
**   master journal pointer could interfere with hot-journal rollback of any
**   subsequently interrupted transaction that reuses the journal file.
**
**   The flag is cleared as soon as the journal file is finalized (either
**   by PagerCommitPhaseTwo or PagerRollback). If an IO error prevents the
**   journal file from being successfully finalized, the setMaster flag
**   is cleared anyway (and the pager will move to ERROR state).
**
** doNotSpill, doNotSyncSpill
**
**   These two boolean variables control the behaviour of cache-spills
**   (calls made by the pcache module to the pagerStress() routine to
**   write cached data to the file-system in order to free up memory).
**
**   When doNotSpill is non-zero, writing to the database from pagerStress()
**   is disabled altogether. This is done in a very obscure case that
**   comes up during savepoint rollback that requires the pcache module
**   to allocate a new page to prevent the journal file from being written
**   while it is being traversed by code in pager_playback().
** 
**   If doNotSyncSpill is non-zero, writing to the database from pagerStress()
**   is permitted, but syncing the journal file is not. This flag is set
**   by sqlite3PagerWrite() when the file-system sector-size is larger than
**   the database page-size in order to prevent a journal sync from happening 
**   in between the journalling of two pages on the same sector. 
**
** subjInMemory
**
**   This is a boolean variable. If true, then any required sub-journal
**   is opened as an in-memory journal file. If false, then in-memory
**   sub-journals are only used for in-memory pager files.
**
**   This variable is updated by the upper layer each time a new 
**   write-transaction is opened.
**
** dbSize, dbOrigSize, dbFileSize
**
**   Variable dbSize is set to the number of pages in the database file.
**   It is valid in PAGER_READER and higher states (all states except for
**   OPEN and ERROR). 
**
**   dbSize is set based on the size of the database file, which may be 
**   larger than the size of the database (the value stored at offset
**   28 of the database header by the btree). If the size of the file
**   is not an integer multiple of the page-size, the value stored in
**   dbSize is rounded down (i.e. a 5KB file with 2K page-size has dbSize==2).
**   Except, any file that is greater than 0 bytes in size is considered
**   to have at least one page. (i.e. a 1KB file with 2K page-size leads
**   to dbSize==1).
**
**   During a write-transaction, if pages with page-numbers greater than
**   dbSize are modified in the cache, dbSize is updated accordingly.
**   Similarly, if the database is truncated using PagerTruncateImage(), 
**   dbSize is updated.
**
**   Variables dbOrigSize and dbFileSize are valid in states 
**   PAGER_WRITER_LOCKED and higher. dbOrigSize is a copy of the dbSize
**   variable at the start of the transaction. It is used during rollback,
**   and to determine whether or not pages need to be journalled before
**   being modified.
**
**   Throughout a write-transaction, dbFileSize contains the size of
**   the file on disk in pages. It is set to a copy of dbSize when the
**   write-transaction is first opened, and updated when VFS calls are made
**   to write or truncate the database file on disk. 
**
**   The only reason the dbFileSize variable is required is to suppress 
**   unnecessary calls to xTruncate() after committing a transaction. If, 
**   when a transaction is committed, the dbFileSize variable indicates 
**   that the database file is larger than the database image (Pager.dbSize), 
**   pager_truncate() is called. The pager_truncate() call uses xFilesize()
**   to measure the database file on disk, and then truncates it if required.
**   dbFileSize is not used when rolling back a transaction. In this case
**   pager_truncate() is called unconditionally (which means there may be
**   a call to xFilesize() that is not strictly required). In either case,
**   pager_truncate() may cause the file to become smaller or larger.
**
** dbHintSize
**
**   The dbHintSize variable is used to limit the number of calls made to
**   the VFS xFileControl(FCNTL_SIZE_HINT) method. 
**
**   dbHintSize is set to a copy of the dbSize variable when a
**   write-transaction is opened (at the same time as dbFileSize and
**   dbOrigSize). If the xFileControl(FCNTL_SIZE_HINT) method is called,
**   dbHintSize is increased to the number of pages that correspond to the
**   size-hint passed to the method call. See pager_write_pagelist() for 
**   details.
**
** errCode
**
**   The Pager.errCode variable is only ever used in PAGER_ERROR state. It
**   is set to zero in all other states. In PAGER_ERROR state, Pager.errCode 
**   is always set to SQLITE_FULL, SQLITE_IOERR or one of the SQLITE_IOERR_XXX 
**   sub-codes.
