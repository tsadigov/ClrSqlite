	/// The most recently coded instruction was an OP_Column to retrieve the
	/// i-th column of table pTab. This routine sets the P4 parameter of the
	/// OP_Column to the default value, if any.
	///
	/// The default value of a column is specified by a DEFAULT clause in the
	/// column definition. This was either supplied by the user when the table
	/// was created, or added later to the table definition by an ALTER TABLE
	/// command. If the latter, then the row-records in the table btree on disk
	/// may not contain a value for the column and the default value, taken
	/// from the P4 parameter of the OP_Column instruction, is returned instead.
	/// If the former, then all row-records are guaranteed to include a value
	/// for the column and the P4 value is not required.
	///
	/// Column definitions created by an ALTER TABLE command may only have
	/// literal default values specified: a number, null or a string. (If a more
	/// complicated default expression value was provided, it is evaluated
	/// when the ALTER TABLE is executed and one of the literal values written
	/// into the sqlite_master table.)
	///
	/// Therefore, the P4 parameter is only required if the default value for
	/// the column is a literal number, string or null. The sqlite3ValueFromExpr()
	/// function is capable of transforming these types of expressions into
	/// sqlite3_value objects.
	///
	/// If parameter iReg is not negative, code an OpCode.OP_RealAffinity instruction
	/// on register iReg. This is used when an equivalent integer value is
	/// stored in place of an 8-byte floating point value in order to save
	/// space.
